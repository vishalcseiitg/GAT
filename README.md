# GAT

This repo describes intended learning outcomes for a project focusing on Graph
Attention Networks (GAT). Primary objective involves understanding fundamental con-
cepts, architectural components, and practical implementation steps involved in designing
a GAT-based solution. By completing this project, learners gain clarity regarding atten-
tion mechanisms applied to graph-structured data and how node representations can
improve through attention-based message passing.
