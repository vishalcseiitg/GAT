# GAT

This repo describes intended learning outcomes for a project focusing on Graph
Attention Networks (GAT). The primary objective involves understanding fundamental concepts, architectural components, and practical implementation steps involved in designing
a GAT-based solution. By completing this project, learners understand attention mechanisms applied to graph-structured data and how node representations can
improve through attention-based message passing.
